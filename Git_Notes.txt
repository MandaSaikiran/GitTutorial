1. Introduction to Git

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to files and collaborate with others. It's widely used in software development.

2. Installation

- Windows: Download the installer from gitscm.com and follow the prompts.
- macOS: Use Homebrew - brew install git.
- Linux: Use the package manager for your distribution (e.g., sudo apt-get install git for Ubuntu).

3. Configuration

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

These commands set your username and email, which are associated with your commits.

- Initialize a Repository: git init
- Clone a Repository: git clone <repository-url>
- Check Status: git status
- Stage Files: git add <file>
- Commit Changes: git commit -m "Commit message"

5. Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to work on different versions of a repository simultaneously.

- Create a Branch: git branch <branch-name>
- Switch to Branch: git checkout <branch-name>
- Merge Branches: git merge <branch-name>
- Delete a Branch: git branch -d <branch-name>

6. Remote Repositories

Collaborate with others by using remote repositories.

- Add Remote: git remote add origin <repository-url>
- Push Changes: git push origin <branch-name>
- Pull Changes: git pull origin <branch-name>
- Fetch Changes: git fetch origin

7. Undoing Changes

- Unstage a File: git reset <file>
- Revert a Commit: git revert <commit-hash>
- Reset to a Previous Commit: git reset --hard <commit-hash>

8. Advanced Topics

- Stashing Changes: git stash and git stash pop
- Tagging: git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Tag message"
- Rebasing: git rebase <branch-name>

9. Git Workflows
